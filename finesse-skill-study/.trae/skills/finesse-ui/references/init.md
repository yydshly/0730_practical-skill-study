# Init — Set Up Project Design Memory

`init` writes a **`PRODUCT.md`** at the project root: the persistent brief finesse reads before every later task, so multi-page projects stay consistent and you stop re-guessing the register/soul/dials each time. Run it once per project (or when the brief has materially changed).

> Why this exists: finesse's §3 color-lock and §5 theme-lock are easy to *state* but hard to *hold* across many pages and many sessions. A committed `PRODUCT.md` is the anchor — the next page reads it instead of drifting.

---

## When to run

- The user starts a new project, or asks to "set up finesse / init".
- Any task begins and **no `PRODUCT.md` exists** at the project root → offer to run `init` first (don't force it; a one-off page doesn't need memory).
- `document` (existing code → `design-model.yaml`) is the companion: `init` captures *intent*, `document` captures *the system already built*. For a brand-new project run `init`; for an existing codebase run both.

---

## Flow

1. **Gather the brief.** From what the user gave you, fill as much as you can. For anything load-bearing and missing, ask **one** sharp question (§0.C discipline) — don't interrogate.
2. **Lock the Three Dials** as project defaults (individual pages can deviate with a reason).
3. **Name the anti-references** — the lazy defaults this brand must avoid, at both altitudes (`anti-cheap.md` §0).
4. **Write `PRODUCT.md`** in the shape below. Keep it short and committed — vague memory is worse than none.
5. Confirm the file with the user, then proceed to the original task reading it as the brief.

## PRODUCT.md shape

```markdown
# {Project} — finesse brief

register: {brand | product}            # decides soul+engine vs component+density
one-liner: {what this product literally is, no buzzwords}

## Users & context
{who uses it, where, under what light/mood — the physical scene that forces the theme}

## Brand personality
soul: {the persona — e.g. "cinematic + reverent", maps to style-personas.md}
voice: {2-3 adjectives for copy tone}

## Locked dials (project defaults)
SOUL: {1-10}   SPECTACLE: {1-10}   DENSITY: {1-10}

## Visual lock
accent: {the one accent that owns every page — name + OKLCH/hex}
theme: {dark | light, with the one-sentence scene that forced it}
type: {display family + body family + optional mono, each with the reason}

## Anti-references (must NOT look like)
- first-order: {category default rejected — "coffee → beige+brass"}
- second-order: {the obvious anti-reference also rejected — "not SaaS-cream → not editorial-typographic-by-reflex"}
- {any specific competitor/aesthetic the user named as off-limits}

## Notes
{anything else that constrains design but isn't in the code}
```

## Rules

- **`PRODUCT.md` overrides your guesses.** Once it exists, §0 Brand Read reads it instead of inferring register/soul from scratch. If the user's new request contradicts it, surface the conflict rather than silently overriding.
- **Don't pad it.** Every line is a constraint the next page must honor. If you don't know a field, ask or leave it explicitly `TBD` — never invent a confident-sounding default.
- **Dials are defaults, not handcuffs.** A single page may run hotter/cooler SPECTACLE with a stated reason; the locked value is the gravity it returns to.
- After writing it, if the project already has code, suggest running `document` to capture the built design system as `design-model.yaml`.
